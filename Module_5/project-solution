In thise file it's gonna be explain the whole process of creating, setuping and deployng application on the droplet:

1. Setup and configure a server on DigitalOcean

- My droplet server has following specification:

Region: Frankfurt [since Im currently located in Germany]
Image: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS x64
Droplet Type: Basic
CPU options: Regular

- I copied my local ssh pub key in droplet server and called it am-droplet-key:

    armin@nb-pf565v12:~/twn-demo-projects/Module_5$ cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub 
    ssh-ed25519 <pub_key_value> armin@armin-ThinkPad

- To be able to connect to my droplet server using it's public IP, I'll create firwall rule "am-ssh-rule" that allows inbound traffic on SSH port 22 
  for public IP (checked in https://whatismyipaddress.com/) of my localhost.

  Also in the droplet network settings I applied previously created rule to my droplet ubuntu-s-1vcpu-512mb-10gb-fra1-01

- After firewall rule has been created and applied to my droplet server, I'll try to establish passwordless SSH connection to root user:

- In order to be able to run java application and Nexus i the future, I'll install java version 8 on this droplet.
    root@ubuntu-s-1vcpu-512mb-10gb-fra1-01:~# java -version
    openjdk version "1.8.0_462"
    OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_462-8u462-ga~us1-0ubuntu2~24.04.2-b08)
    OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.462-b08, mixed mode)
