In thise file it's gonna be explain the whole process of creating, setuping and deployng application on the droplet:

1. Setup and configure a server on DigitalOcean

- My droplet server has following specification:

Region: Frankfurt [since Im currently located in Germany]
Image: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS x64
Droplet Type: Basic
CPU options: Regular

- I copied my local ssh pub key in droplet server and called it am-droplet-key:
    armin@nb-pf565v12:~/twn-demo-projects/Module_5$ cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub 
    ssh-ed25519 <pub_key_value> armin@armin-ThinkPad
